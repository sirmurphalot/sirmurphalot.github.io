    <h3>Research Interests</h3>
    I develop novel fiducial approaches to classical inferential problems and illustrate the usefulness in context to current methods.  I am broadly interested in the intersection between classical Geometry and modern Statistics, especially from the fiducial perspective.  My research often also involves Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs); under this wide umbrella, I am currently engaged in projects that are both purely theoretical and applied.  My applied work on GGMs is with the Mayo Clinic and involves detecting drift or abrupt changes to data.

    <h3>Teaching</h3>
    Due to funding from the Mayo Clinic, I will not be teaching for the remainder of my PhD program.  I report this news with great enthusiasm, yet still with some melancholy.  Teaching is a passion of mine and I know that it will be in my future.

    <h3>Brief Bio</h3>
    I'm a born-and-raised Pittsburgh-er who traveled down south to pursue my dream of being a Statistics professor.  When that dream changed, I headed westward.  When I'm not thinking about math and coding, I'm swimming, dancing, and singing loudly in the shower.
