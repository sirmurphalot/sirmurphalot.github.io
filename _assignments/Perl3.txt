############ QUESTION SECTION

One of the teaching aims at UNC is to encourage and integrate "diverse perspectives in the classroom".  This can be especially challenging to do in a quantitative course, but I am hoping to at least make an effort by <I>using your experiences to make my in-class examples</I>!  Before our next class, please shoot me an email to introduce yourself a bit (use subject line '[Your section number]::[Your last name]').  Besides telling me literally anything you'd like me to know about you, please tell me about one of the following: a cultural tradition, a holiday you celebrate, something about where you are from, your family history, or literally anything that significantly affects how you view the world.  I will try to incorporate as much of the diverse perspectives of our class in my examples.  Hopefully this will give us all a chance to learn about things that are significant to each of us. <br>
<br>
<u>Note</u>: If you do not want me to (respectfully) use what you tell me in an example, that is totally understandable.  Just let me know in your email.



############ ANSWER SECTION
