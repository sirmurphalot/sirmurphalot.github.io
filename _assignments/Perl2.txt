Schoolyard jeers can sting and bruise, but perhaps not as much as a 5-man tackle.  It is best to turn the cheek when face-to-face with an adolescent tormentor.  Unless, of course, that villain is holding the ball on the rugby field.  In that case...full speed ahead!!

You've practiced all summer and you are ready to kick-butt this coming rugby season.  From all your summer skirmishes, you know that the probability that you win any game is <eqn $prob>.  Suppose the probability that you win a given game is independent of your victory (or lack thereof) in any other game, and that ties are not possible.
<br>
<br>
a) What's the probability that, during the next <eqn $binom_n> games, you win <eqn $binom_x> of them? <_>
<br>
<br>
b) What's the probability that, during the next <eqn $binom_n> games, you lose <eqn $binom_x> of them? <_>
<br>
<br>
c) What's the probability that, during the next <eqn $binom_n> games, you win more than <eqn $binom_x> of them? <_>
<br>
<br>
d) What's the probability that you have your <eqn $nb_r>th win on the <eqn $nb_k>th game you play? <_>
<br>
<br>
e) What's the probability that you have your <eqn $nb_r>th win sometime after the <eqn $nb_k>th game you play? <_>
<br>
<br>
<SECTION>f) All of the questions up until now are applications of various probability distributions we have discussed in this class.  What are the assumptions needed for <i>all</i> of these probability distributions? <_>
<br>
<br>
<SECTION>g) Say the average number of trys (the means of scoring points in Rugby) your team scores in an hour is <eqn $lambda>.  What is the probability that your team scores less than <eqn $pois_x> trys in the next hour? <_><br>
<br>
h) What is the standard deviation of trys in the next hour? <_>
