					<h2 class="blogtitle">Reproducibility of Machine Learning and Statistical <br/>Techniques to Predict Sepsis Progression</h2>
					</div>
					<br>			  
					<div class="blogdata">Abstract </div>
				
					<div class="blogdata">A variety of machine learning algorithms have been developed to predict a

person’s risk of developing sepsis in a hospital setting. Practical strategies

to applying the published models in real world settings are largely absent

and limit easy reproducibility of the results. Further these models are of-
ten limited by the nature of data sets examined and lack of a consistent

disease framework in which to test the aggregate models. The goal of our

work was to determine the reproducibility of a selected group of published,

clinically relevant risk prediction models and compare the predictive accu-
racy of the different simulations. We tested various classifier methods on

both the MIMIC II data set and a data set gathered from Geisinger Health

System (GHS). Multivariate logistic regression, decision tree, support vec-
tor machines and artificial neural network simulations were conducted using similar features in both data sets. We found that reproduction errors oc-
curred largely with disease definition and classification rather than with the

type of machine learning classifier used. We report that all tested simula-
tions resulted in comparable predictive power for the

two different data sets after resolving the above challenges.</div>

Our team chose a project commissioned by Bucknell's Griot Institute (for Africana Studies) to help create an interactive map to creatively display the history of the sugar mill of Antigua.  To complete this project, we have followed an agile/scrum methodology, and relied heavily on the previous expertise of our team members.  On this team, my major contribution was the handling of the Antigua sugar mill data, and the creation of an interface that would allow the researchers at the Griot Institute to update the information in the map without any coding skills.

					<h2 class="blogtitle">Comparing Sequences of Finite States with Non-Uniform Time Intervals <br/>Senior Honors Thesis</h2>
					</div>
					<br>			  
					<div class="blogdata">While many envision data as something strictly organized as a matrix of observations and
variables, there are actually a wide variety ways that information can be structured and
represented. One such way is by having the data arranged in ordered sequences, where each
element in the sequence is some sort of categorical variable. Common examples of such data
would be sentences in a book, where the words are our categorical variables and the sentences
the sequences; or strands of DNA, in which long sequences of nucleotides encoded as the
categorical variables A, C, G, or T appear in various permutations. In each of these cases,
a dataset would contain multiple sequences, which would each contain some combination of
categorical variables. A common task within the fields of statistics and computer science is
to perform a comparison of any two sequences. The study of DNA strands illustrates the
potential usefulness of this task; identifying similar sequences between patients could provide
explanation for parallels between their medical histories. In practice, such comparisons are
                        often done by pairwise sequence alignment algorithms. </div>
                  
                  <div class="blogdata"> The main goal of this project is to extend the existing capabilities of common pairwise alignment algorithms. In some types of sequence data, it is possible to examine the time between each instance of a categorical variable. Accessible examples include different drugs
given to patients in a hospital and the order of links clicked by users of a website, each over
a period of time. Our goal is to take advantage of these measures of time between elements
organized in a finite sequence. Through our method that considers this information, we may
be able to better compare the likeness of two distinct sequences and provide a useful tool for
the scholarly community.</div>
