  <h3>EAS with Graphical Models</h3> <br>
  The overarching aim of my research is to bring what has come to be known as the EAS methodology for model selection to GGMs, which will introduce a creative new means for graphical selection in GGMs, as well as a new way to predict general precision matrices. The EAS methodology leverages notions of redundancy to manage the size of the sample space of possible models: $M$. The beauty of this approach is that it realistically expects and addresses the ubiquitous issue of huge numbers of variables $p$ and sample sets $n$: a problem that causes the probability of every possible model (including the true model $M_0$) to tend towards zero. In numerous cases, this approach gives strong consistency of the posterior-like probability of the true oracle model.  Another particularly attractive aspect of EAS is that it uses recent advances in Generalized Fiducial Inference (GFI) to derive a probability distribution of possible models, without the need for an arbitrary prior. This opens up a means for analysis beyond mere point estimation, such as confidence regions for the true model $M_0$. </p>
