    <h3>STOR 155: Introduction to Data Analysis, Summer Session I 2020</h3><br>
    As they become available to my students, I will post my lecture notes and videos here.  Unfortunately, the homework assignments I have written are only available through <a href="https://www.webassign.net">WebAssign</a>.  Please reach out if you would like any advice on writeing self-grading questions with perl (to be used on <a href="https://www.webassign.net">WebAssign</a>) since this is something that I have studied extensively.  <br>The open-access textbook I am using for this course is the second addition of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2lwGKhIFjYYX1pJelpHa0NMUWM/view">OpenIntro Statistics</a> that was modified for UNC by my collegue <a href="https://stat-or.unc.edu/people/faculty/robin-cunningham">Robin Cunningham</a>.  I follow things pretty closely for the first three chapters, then take things mostly in my own direction for Chapter 4 onward.

<h3>STOR 565: Machine Learning, Spring 2020</h3><br>
    The following are the computing assignments (CAs) used for the course I am taught with Dr. Andrew Nobel during Spring 2020.  These assignments are written by myself, with the occasional (shameless) stealing of exercises from my collegues <a href="https://www.kelly-bodwin.com/">Kelly Bodwin</a>,  <a href="https://idc9.github.io/">Iain Carmichael</a>, and <a href="http://jdwilson-statistics.com/">James Wilson</a>.<br>

<b>Update as of March 18th, 2020:</b>
    Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, submission of all Computer Assignments from CA08 and onward were submitted using the online portal <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/">gradescope</a>.  Furthermore, all instruction was quickly adapted to be remote.
<br>
<br>  
<b>Final Project:</b>
    Teaching while dealing with a global pandemic was a tremulous affair.  Dr. Andrew Nobel and I were very careful to balance the work load required to really learn the material with what we believed to be a reasonable work load to give to students in distress.  In the end, I wrote two projects: the <a id="raw-url" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirmurphalot/sirmurphalot.github.io/master/_assignments/Final_Project_Original.pdf">full draft</a>, which would have been given under regular circumstances, and the <a id="raw-url" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirmurphalot/sirmurphalot.github.io/master/_assignments/Final_Project_Updated.pdf">second draft</a>, which we believed was more manageable for our students.
